# GuelderEngine

GuelderEngine is planned to be a simple game engine, however due to my school I don't have much time for it, but I try to maintain this project. It uses a Vulkan API to achieve rendering. This engine supports 2D and 3D rendering.

## Requirements 
Vulkan 1.3.255, C++20, CMake 3.8 and greater

## How to build

Download the code, put it into folder, make in that folder another one, like "Build" and from that folder open cmd and run 
```bash
cmake ..
```
Then open project in your IDE(I use a VS2022, so I don't know whether it will work on other IDE's).

I know that it is poor, but...
